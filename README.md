## 🧩 Problem Statement – Skill Swap Platform

> This is the **first problem statement** provided in the hackathon question set.

### 📌 Objective

Design and develop a **Skill Swap Platform**, a web-based application that enables users to exchange skills with one another. The platform aims to promote collaborative learning by allowing users to offer skills they possess and request skills they wish to acquire.

### 🧠 Simplified Explanation

Imagine a platform where people teach each other for free — someone who knows Photoshop can help someone who knows Excel, and vice versa. This application works like a **knowledge exchange** system where no money is involved, only skills.

It’s useful for students, professionals, or hobbyists who want to grow by sharing what they know and learning what they don’t.
